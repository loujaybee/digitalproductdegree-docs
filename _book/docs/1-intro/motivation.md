The why for Digital Product Degree.

## Reason 1: Because I can't not

Many writers talk about writing a book because you have a demon inside of you. This book is my version of that demon. It's a challenge to the writer to take all the competing ideas that float around in their heads and to get it onto paper in a coherent way. And then to walk away and say "Right, it's there, it's done".

In other words: I can't _not_ write it.

## Reason 2: To help others (and answer questions)

A lot of my writing online so far has been about writing to answer peoples questions.

I get asked questions all the time. Questions like:

* How do I build a website?
* How do I build an app?
* How did you build that website?

This book will answer these questions.

## Reason 3: To share industry insight

Not only that — but to share insight in how the best technology companies in the world operate and how they:

* Sort the wheat from the chaff when it comes to their product ideas
* What mindset they have when they approach problems
* How they structure their teams
* How they fight the inevitable complexities of building a digital product
* Communicate and execute on their product vision

And then there's the questions I don't get asked. When I know something and I want to share it. But, unfortunately it doesn't exist.

## Reason 4: To align disparate ideas

The industry has expanded massively in recent years. Many ideas, frameworks and methodologies exist: UX, DevOps, Scrum, Agile, XP. These ideas and concepts are often warped, overplayed and made more confusing by the industry.

So this book will tackle what these terms really mean — from a practical standpoint.

## Reason 5: An up-to-date digital degree

Degree's are old hat. They're too slow for the digital economy. Bootcamps do a good job of training technical skills. But what is missing is that holistic understanding of how products are made.

This book addresses that. And being online, and open-source it's an incredibly adaptive resource.
