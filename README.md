# Digital Product Degree

The Digital Product Degree Project is a free, open-source book. It's a collection of: Articles, resources and definitions designed to give you all the tools you need to build a digital product.

I started writing this book as I had many questions in my job, as a programmer, of how to build a digital product. When I came to start building my own products (and I slowly started unpeeling everything that goes into this) I started to see just how much goes into building a digital product.

What was frustrating was that there are _so_ many concepts and ideas some that overlap, some that don't: Scrum, Agile, Devops, Cloud, Architecture, Programming Languages.

And most of the content online was fragmented, or highly technical. It also didn't show me how each concept would blend into the next. A lot goes into building a digital product and it can be really overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be. That's why I set about writing this book.

## How I'm writing it

Because writing a book takes an incredible amount of time, I'm doing it piece by piece. I'll be bringing in separate articles that I published in different publications around the internet. Eventually this should form some sort of coherent whole. This means that each article should _in theory_ stand entirely on it's own, so you can dive in as you need.

This might explain why the chapter titles have ✓'s and ✗'s next to them. This just shows me how far that I've got and how much more I've got to do.

The goal is at the end to end up with a choppy first book draft. I want to them take this to a publisher and have it turned into a physical product. Once edited etc, it would be nice to redistribute the edited version back online for free.

If you're anything like me, a physical copy of a book is considerably more enjoyable than a markdown generated one that you have to read, hunched over your laptop.
