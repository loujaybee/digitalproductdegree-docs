# Digital Product Degree

The Digital Product Degree Project is a free, open-source collection of the best resources and definitions on how to build and grow a website, app or webapp.

## Labelling

As the project is open source, the content is build slowly over time. In order to avoid confusion, any pages that are unstarted will have the code [TODO] before the title. Any that are in progress will have [DRAFT] before the title. All other pages are 'complete' (or rather, simply free from known errors).
