# Digital Product Degree

The Digital Product Degree Project is a free, open-source book.

It's a collection of:

* Resources
* Definitions
* Articles

On how to build and grow a digital product such as a website, app or webapp.

## How to use the book

Depending on your background, experience and interests you may choose to consume the book in a combination of manners. Each chapter / section is designed in isolation and shouldn't require prior knowledge so should stand on it's own.

**Option 1)** Read the book in it's entirety — Either by reading each article in depth, or by skim reading initially to understand the main concepts.

**Option 2)** Use it as a continual reference — When you reach a certain point on the digital product you work on or have built you can use the book to answer your questions relating to your particular stage of growth.


## [TODO/DRAFT]

As the project is open source and emergent the content will build slowly over time. In order to avoid confusion, any pages that are unstarted will have the code [TODO] before the title. Any that are in progress will have [DRAFT] before the title. All other pages are 'complete' (or rather, simply free from known errors).
