# Book Structure

The book is split into 3 parts.

#### Part I: Idea

In this section we'll discuss how you take abstract ideas and make them a reality. It's also about the mindset of creating a product. Understanding whether you should, and developing the right motivations for doing so.

#### Part II: Build

The meat of the book, actually building the product. This section is concerned with how you formulate your team, break down features, prioritise and ultimately get the product out of the door.

#### Part III: Scale

Assuming that you've already got a product and now you're looking to grow it. This section is separate as you should be able to ignore it whilst you're building a product. But once launched, you're going to need to read this section in order to deal with the inevitable pains that arise when you've got a functioning, out-there digital product.

## Resources

For each section there will be relevant resources listed at the bottom. These will include cheatsheets, links, print-outs etc related to the previous sections.
