# Motivation

Just in case you were wondering: Why bother writing The Digital Product Degree?

## Reason 1: Because I feel I have to

Many writers talk about writing a book because you have a demon inside of you. This book is my version of that demon.

I need to get the idea out on paper to say "Right, it's there, it's done". It's an odd motivation, but it's very compelling.

## Reason 2: To help others (and answer questions)

A lot of my writing online so far has been about writing to answer peoples questions.

I get asked questions all the time. Questions like:

* How do I build a website?
* How do I build an app?
* How did you build that website?

And then there's the questions I don't get asked. When I know something and I want to share it. But, unfortunately it doesn't exist.

This book will contain the answers to the questions I get.

## Reason 3: To structure my own thoughts

I love building digital products.

So I write a lot on this topic. Writing helps me clear up my own thoughts and solidify ideas that I've had about building digital products.

## Reason 4: Because I like to read

I won't lie, I love reading... and I love digital products.

I have a somewhat perverse goal of reading pretty much every book about digital products.

So, as I go, I'm may as well continue to write up the best bits of what I read.

## Reason 5: To do a better job than a real degree

When I studied for my degree, I yearned for practical insight. I wanted the insight scoop, not theory and history. Things I could use straight away, not things I might use, maybe (probably not).

I want to provide information that's more up to date and more dynamic than a regular degree.

## Reason 6: To be practical and approachable

I love it when I find a book or a resource that explains something to me in a super simple way.

Something that makes me feel super smart, not dumb.

I also think that everyone has a right to an education and I want to lower the barriers to this education as much as possible.

Building digital products should be for everyone. Not just those lucky enough to be able to pay for the education for it.
