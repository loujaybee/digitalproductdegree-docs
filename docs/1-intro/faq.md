### Who is this for?

**Developers / Engineers** — Anyone already making a digital product, who has technology skills but wants to understand how the other parts of the business work

**Non-Techies in Tech** — Anyone who works in tech, but didn't start off this way. This is usually people like product owners that have moved into technology to be the voice of the business.

**Entrepreneurs** — Someone who is thinking about, or trying to build a digital product

### What is a Digital Product?

I chose not to call this "Web App Degree" or "App Degree" as the concepts discussed are applicable to building a digital product of any kind.

Currently, this is likely to be apps, web apps or even progressive web apps. Wondering the difference? Not a problem, we'll cover that.

### Will it be technical?

The point of this book is to be completely non-technical. So it can be approached by someone outside of the industry with no prior knowledge.

Any topics discussed will be explained at some point beforehand.
